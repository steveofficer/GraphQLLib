# GraphQLLib
This is a bare-bones, F# based GraphQL parser for .NET

It uses [FParsec](https://www.quanttec.com/fparsec/) under the hood to perform the parsing.

This project is partially to get more practise with FParsec, partially to gain an understanding of GraphQL queries, and partially the foundation for creating a GraphQL engine on top of Entity Framework.
